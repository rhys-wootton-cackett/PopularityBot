CHANGELOG
---------

v2.0 - 
-----------------
* The bot now supports the original 32 Nintendo tracks!
	* Commands have been reworked so you can search for either Nintendo tracks or CTGP revoluion tracks. i.e. `!nintop` will list the top 10 Nintendo tracks, and `!ctgpbottom` will list the bottom 10 CTGP Revolution tracks.
* `!show` has been remade to `!ninlist` and `!ctgplist` with the following changes:
	* The command now asks for a start point and end point, which should make it easier to use.
	* It correctly lists up to 25 tracks with this change.

* I have removed the breakdown of popularity in the main commands as it was starting to clog them up. If you wish to see a tracks popularity based on only WiimmFi or Time Trials, you can still use the additional arguments `wf` or `tt`.
* Searching has been improved once again. It should now be slightly less harsh but still effective. For example, a search for 'asdf' now finds 'ASDF_Course'.

* A lot of code refactoring has happened, which should make it easier to read through the command handler if you wish to!

v1.4 - 02/01/2021
-----------------
* NEW COMMAND: '!wiki' will send a list of links to tracks based on a search parameter from the Custom Mario Kart Wiiki for tracks that are in CTGP Revolution.
* If you put incorrect parameters into a command (for example, '!showtop wt' is invalid), you will be sent the help for the command telling you how to use it. 
* Turns out setting up polling was broken as it wouldn't allow you to add settings. You should be able to setup polling now!
* I've made polling more loose in its wording, so now you can set up polls for anything related to Mario Kart Wii!
* For a bit of visual appeal, the bot now says it is typing when responding to a command.
* Timestamps should not be in the time zone you are in.

v1.3 - 29/12/2020
-----------------
* The formula for calculating popularity has been changed. It should now reflect new tracks coming into the pack much fairer than previously. To read about it, go here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8grliYKX-d5vtrzCJ8DM1oAyANC2sTTfOzBlJeMzaQ/edit?usp=sharing.
* The algorithm for getting WiimmFi popularity has been improved. It now stops scanning the website after all 218 tracks have been updated, which it did not do previously. This should both reduce the number of requests to the WiimmFi site, and result in slightly faster updates.

v1.2 - 17/12/2020
-----------------
* A bug was found where poll settings were not being updated. This has now been fixed.
* The bot now displays how many servers and members it is currently helping. At the moment it is only this one, but I plan on releasing this more publically soon!
* Cooldowns have now been implemented. All public commands have a limit of 5 per 60 seconds per user. If you try to go over the limit, the bot will notify you and tell you how long you have left until you can submit that command again.
* NEW COMMAND: '!github' sends a link to the GitHub hosting the bot's source code.
* NEW COMMAND: "!donate" sends a link to my donation page and GitHub sponsers page. Hosting this bot costs me money (around $5 a month using DigitalOceans VPS), and whilst I can afford it at the moment, help from people that like and use the bot would be super helpful. All donations would be put straight into the DigitalOcean account, so you can feel safe knowing that the money does go directly to support the bot's hosting and development, along with helping me work on other project to do with CTGP. Don't feel as though you need to donate, but any amount if you can donate would be very appreciated :)

v1.1 - 15/12/2020
-----------------
* The algorithm for getting WiimmFi popularity has been improved, and now searches exclusively using a tracks SHA1 hash, making it more reliable. However, this comes at a cost of the bot sending a load more requests to the WiimmFi website, so bot updates will take longer (set to update now every 55-60 minutes).
* The search algorithm has been made harsher. It now only searches for specific words in a track. Single letter searches yield no results now. This should fix a search for 'DS' showing other tracks containing words such as "grounds".

* '!show' commands now show the sum of popularity by showing its Time Trial and WiimmFi popularity in that order e.g. "N64 Rainbow Road (38) [29 + 9]".
* '!getpopularity' has been changed to '!find'., so now you don't have to type in so much!

* NEW COMMAND: '!explainpop' will explain how popularity is calculated. I've removed it from all '!show' commands as it was starting to clog up the embed in my opinion.
* NEW COMMAND: All commands have overloads for only ranking by Time Trials and WiimmFi popularity. To do these, use 'tt' for Time Trials or 'wf' for Wiimmfi.
			   Examples: '!showtop tt'
						 '!showbottom wf'
						 '!showtopbottom tt'
						 '!show 5 15 wf'
						 '!find gcn tt'

* Polling is now persistent if the bot goes down, and should work across multiple servers when I come to push this publically!
